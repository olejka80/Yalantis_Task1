# Yalantis_Task1
First task for Yalantis

In my opinion, the following UI mistakes in the screen and
suggestions to solve them:

1. The button arrow back too big and the title next to the arrow back is not readable. 
   Set the correct title and the arrow back.

2. Side opposite the text "Комунальне господарство" is empty.
   Сustom TextView move to the opposite side and the text do little increase.

3. A distance between the dividers is different, middle divider thinner than others.
   Set the correct distance between the dividers and the same height.
